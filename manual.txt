RUST CONSOLE CALCULATOR - COMPREHENSIVE MANUAL
==============================================

This calculator supports complex mathematical expressions with functions,
constants, and various operations. Below is a complete reference guide.

1. BASIC OPERATIONS:
   + : Addition           (e.g., 5 + 3)
   - : Subtraction        (e.g., 7 - 2)
   * : Multiplication     (e.g., 4 * 6)
   / : Division           (e.g., 9 / 3)
   % : Modulo             (e.g., 10 % 3)
   ^ : Exponentiation     (e.g., 2 ^ 3 = 8)
   r : Root operation     (e.g., 8 r 3 = 2)

2. MATHEMATICAL FUNCTIONS:
   sin(x)   : Sine of x (x in degrees)
   cos(x)   : Cosine of x (x in degrees)
   tan(x)   : Tangent of x (x in degrees)
   asin(x)  : Arcsine (returns degrees, x ∈ [-1,1])
   acos(x)  : Arccosine (returns degrees, x ∈ [-1,1])
   atan(x)  : Arctangent (returns degrees)
   ln(x)    : Natural logarithm (x > 0)
   log(x)   : Base-10 logarithm (x > 0)
   exp(x)   : Exponential function (e^x)
   abs(x)   : Absolute value
   floor(x) : Round down to nearest integer
   ceil(x)  : Round up to nearest integer
   round(x) : Round to nearest integer

3. CONSTANTS:
   pi : π (3.141592653589793)
   e  : Euler's number (2.718281828459045)

4. SYNTAX EXAMPLES:
   Basic: 2 + 3 * 4
   Functions: sin(45) + cos(45)
   Nested: 2 * (3 + 4)
   Complex: exp(ln(5)) + (10 r 2) * abs(-5)
   Scientific: 1.2e3 * 2 = 2400

5. KEYBOARD SHORTCUTS:
   ← / →    : Move cursor left/right
   Backspace: Delete character before cursor
   Delete   : Delete character under cursor
   Home     : Jump to start of line
   End      : Jump to end of line
   ↑ / ↓    : Navigate through history
   Enter    : Calculate expression
   q        : Quit calculator
   help     : Show this manual

6. ADVANCED USAGE:
   - Expressions can include multiple nested parentheses
   - Scientific notation is supported (e.g., 1.2e3 = 1200)
   - Spaces are optional but can be used for readability
   - History is preserved between calculations
   - Errors show detailed explanations
